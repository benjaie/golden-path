title: Validation-time pagination limits
---

## Summary

Enforce page-size and pagination-window bounds during GraphQL validation,
including argument values supplied through variables.

## Practices implemented

- [Pagination limits](/practice/pagination-limits)

## Applies to

- GraphQL servers
- Gateways and proxies

## Configuration (suggested defaults)

| Parameter | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `defaultPageSize` | `20` | Used when limit arg is omitted. |
| `maxPageSize` | `100` | Reject over-limit per-field requests. |
| `maxPaginationWindow` | `1000` | Reject oversized windows. |
| `enforcement` | `reject` | Return stable validation errors. |

## Implementation notes

- Evaluate argument values after variable coercion.
- Apply rule consistently to all list-returning fields.
- Include machine-readable error metadata for tooling.

## Cautions

- Requires schema conventions for identifying pagination args.
- Custom directives may need explicit rule integration.

## Problems addressed

- [DoS via runtime execution](/problem/runtime-dos)
- [Execution cost spikes](/problem/execution-cost)
- [Request payload size](/problem/request-payload-size)
